# Snake
Snake game written in Go.

## How to play
Each time you start a new game a level with a different cluster of stones is generated. 
You can eat stones, but beware! It makes snake puke which results in shorter body :(

Use arrows (or h,j,k,l) for movement.

```!``` -> hardcode mode, snake chokes on stones instantly...

```r``` -> restart game

```ESC/q``` -> quit game
